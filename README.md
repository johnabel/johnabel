## Hello! 👋

I'm a scientist trained in machine learning, systems biology, and chemical engineering. I currently manage a small ML and engineering team at Repertoire (https://github.com/cogentherapeutics). We're working on engineering the immune synapse via machine learning. Previously I was at {PathAI, MIT, MGH, Harvard}.

Places I exist online are:
- here, of course
- twitter/gram (@jxhnabel)
- publications (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1AYZ0IAAAAAJ)
- email (jhabel01-at-gmail.com)

Outside of work you can generally find me 🧑‍🧑‍🧒 ⛷ 🛫  🤘
